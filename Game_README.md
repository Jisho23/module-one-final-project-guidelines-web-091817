Game Mechanics

Our Trivia Game is amazing fun! The layout is fairly self-explanatory, but we'll give a run-down anyways.

To start the game, run 'ruby bin/run.rb'. Look!  A fun little welcome message! The game pauses after 'What's your name?' and waits for you to enter your name.

CREATE USERNAME
The first step is to create a username. We recommend your name, but it is case-sensitive ('Santa' isn't the same as 'santa').
If you already have a username, just type that in, and it will find you! If, for some reason, you need to delete a username, enter '3.14159' instead, and
it will let you delete a username by entering the username to be removed (remember, be specific, and careful here. Deleted users are gone forever).

STARTING THE GAME
Once you select or create a new user, its on to the game!
'What do you want to do?'. Here, you have 5 options: play a new game, check statistics, change your user, check leaderboard, and exit. We'll take those one at a time.
'PLAYGAMEPLAYGAMEPLAYGAME': Starts a new game of TRIVIA! Go to 'GAMEPLAY' section below.
'Check Stats': Checks your personal stats for all game this username has played
  -There are 3 new options: All time average, statistics by difficulty, and Back to start. All time average shows how many questions you've correctly answered out of how many total, statistics divided amongst each difficulty level, and Back to start takes you back to PLAYING THE GAME. If you haven't played any games, you'll get a little message telling you that.
'Change User': Brings you back to CREATE USERNAME
'Check Leaderboard': Displays all users' correctly answered question tally and percentages! Beat your friends!
'Exit': You don't want to play anymore :( This will exit you out of the game. Come back soon!

GAMEPLAY
Once you select PLAYGAMEPLAYGAMEPLAYGAME, you get a totally unbiased and modest statement of the quality of our game. Now you need to choose your difficulty. Easy, Medium, Hard, or Exit. These will set the difficulty of the questions for the TRIVIA GAME, or exit the game.
Next, choose how many questions you'd like to have in your TRIVIA GAME!
A new quiz will be created based on your inputs.

The questions will show up in pink, with the answers below.  Just enter the number corresponding number to select that answer. Play until you reach the end! (Incorrect answers will... you'll find out :D).

Don't worry! When you get a question wrong, it will tell you what the correct answer is.

Once you finish a game, your score for that game of TRIVIA will show up, and bring you back to STARTING THE GAME. Play another game, or check out your stats!

Thanks for playing!
